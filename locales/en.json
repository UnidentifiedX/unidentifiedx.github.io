Like many kids back then, I wanted to be the next big game developer, which led me to learn <b>C#</b> and <b>Unity</b> at 12. Around the same time, I started building Discord bots, kicking off my <b>JavaScript</b> journey with <b>Node.js</b>. In secondary school, I expanded into <b>Python</b>, <b>SQL</b>, and web development using <b>Flask</b> and <b>Jinja</b> through computing class.<br><br>My passion for research began in Secondary 2, and I've since completed two <b>chemistry</b>, one <b>physics</b>, and one <b>engineering</b> project. I aspire to intern in and contribute to engineering and science in the future.<br><br>When I'm not coding or researching, you'll find me reading sci-fi, watching anime, or scrolling through cat reels on Instagram."
